# OTHub-io

OTHub-io is the next iteration of [OTHub](https://github.com/OT-Hub/OTHub) with a new vision for the future.

## Description
OTHub-io seeks to incorporate and augment the hallmark features that distinguished OTHub, paving the way for broader adoption. It not only continues to provide a comprehensive overview of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph V6 network statistics to all participants but also introduces bespoke dashboards for asset publishers and DKG network stakeholders. The main focus is to enhance accessibility, efficiency, and user-friendliness for the publication of new knowledge assets on the ecosystem. Expanding OTHub's scope, the platform will serve as the foundational layer - the OTHub portal, enabling other projects and individuals to seamlessly get, update, and publish knowledge assets via OTHub-api and OTHub-bot.

The following repositories represent the architecture diagram of OTHub-io:
